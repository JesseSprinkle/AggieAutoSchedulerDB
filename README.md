# AggieAutoSchedulerDB

This is the database I was using to store the courses used in the AggieAutoScheduler website. To get this data, I used a webscraper because Texas A&M doesn't believe in APIs for some reason. If they just had an api, there would be no reason to have this unless I wanted to use it in case their API goes down.
